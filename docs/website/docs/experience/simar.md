SIMAR (Système Informatique Maritime et Aérien de la Réunion) is a software suite developed by [4SH](4sh.md) for Infoport. Infoport is specialized in organizing the communication between the various actors of the freight industry in La Réunion, a French island in the Indian Ocean.

SIMAR is deployed in the East Harbour, which is the only container harbour of the island, as well as the Roland Garros airport (RUN), the only commercial airport of the island.
The volcanic island is not agriculturally active enough to feed its almost 1 million inhabitants, who rely on imports from mainland Europe, India and Australia.

Handling freight operations efficiently is therefore critical to the livelihood of the population. However, the harbour is constrained by its comparatively small surface area, and its unusual cooperation of three different companies on the facilities (whereas most other harbours in the world are owned by a single company).

SIMAR aggregates data from many domain sources, including company-specific handling tools, and tracks legal authorizations of all goods, reporting discrepancies or unauthorized movements to French customs.
