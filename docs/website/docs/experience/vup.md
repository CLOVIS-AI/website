NAXOS is the software editor of the real estate company [Century 21](https://www.century21.fr/), focusing on creating internal tools to help their employees. For more than a decade, 4SH has helped NAXOS build their projects.

One of these projects is VUA/VUP, an internal application used by branch offices to track their progress and objectives throughout the year. These are later used to decide bonuses.

## My involvement

I was brought in during summer 2025 for the rewrite of the VUP project. The VUP app consists of 300+ Key Performance Indicators (KPI) that are computed from aggregate data generated by multiple other systems. The existing app used MyBatis and massive SQL scripts to compute the KPIs overnight, whereas the client now wanted to be able to compute them live based on different parameters.

My work on VUP focused on a SQL generator to convert simple mathematical expressions of the KPIs into complex SQL queries aggregating data from heterogeneous sources, as well as performance analysis of that generator.
