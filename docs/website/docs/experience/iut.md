The University Institute of Technology (IUT) is a department of the Bordeaux University that dispenses two-year specialization courses. 

I joined the IUT in 2017 after graduating from high school. At the IUT, I took multiple options, including the "International Course" which includes several classes being organized entirely in English, and the "Innovation Club" which encourages students to learn new technology (in my case, by participating in [the Arbalet project](https://www.facebook.com/GaredeBordeauxStJean/videos/arbalet-saint-jean/1762890610397288/)).
