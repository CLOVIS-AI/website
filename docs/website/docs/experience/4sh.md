4SH is a French software company mainly based in Bordeaux, France. Composed of around 100 employees, 4SH is proud of its great atmosphere and collaboration between all job titles.

## Project diversity

4SH works for clients in many different domains. For example, 4SH handles the **200 000+ electrical charging stations** of [IZIVIA](https://izivia.com/), the French government-owned electrical network company.

4SH also develops the applications of the [BeCLM group](https://www.beclm.com/), specialist on compliance solutions for the banking and insurance industries, including **detection of embezzling**.

4SH is a major player in the freight industry, developing the tracking systems for multiple airports and harbours, including the Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG) and the East harbour of La Réunion.

Finally, 4SH develops many smaller projects, including project-management solutions, a serious game for accounting students, tools for journalists…

## Perpetual improvement

4SH believes in continuous learning, and offers 15 days a year to all employees to work on personal projects to discover new technologies or create their own. I use this program to develop the [Decouple framework](https://gitlab.com/opensavvy/ui/decouple), a way to share code between all Compose-based targets in a Kotlin Multiplatform project.

Thanks to 4SH, I have been able to attend multiple conferences, including [BDX IO](https://bdxio.fr/) and [KotlinConf 2024](https://kotlinconf.com/2024).

I have been part of a task force around revitalizing monthly meetings between developers to encourage cross-project knowledge sharing, and I organize the internal diffusion of talks for developers.
I have also given multiple internal talks on Kotlin.

## My involvement

I joined 4SH in 2022 as a Software Engineer after graduating from [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](enseirb.md).

Between 2022 and 2024, I was part of the CIN project, which handles freight traffic in multiple French airports, including the Charles de Gaulle airport. [Learn more in the dedicated page](cin.md).

As of 2024, I'm a member of the SIMAR project, which handles all container traffic for La Réunion, a French island in the Indian Ocean with almost one million inhabitants, which almost entirely relies on freight from mainland Europe for food production and other essential goods.
