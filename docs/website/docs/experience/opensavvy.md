In 2022, I co-created OpenSavvy, an open source software collective centered around automation, system administration and Kotlin Multiplatform. 

OpenSavvy has multiple core values:

- **Open Source** — Code that cannot be read, cannot be trustworthy
- **Free** — Running our projects on your own hardware is free
- **Security** — Users retain full control over their data, with full transparency over security threats
- **Quality** — A tool that doesn't work is of use to no one
- **Automation** — The only way to move fast without sacrificing any of the above is to automate _everything_

OpenSavvy projects are created when we need them and are thus, by nature, dogfood-built.
