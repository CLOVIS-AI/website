# Hi!

I'm a software engineer specialized in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

I'm currently employed at [4SH](experience/4sh.md), in Bordeaux, France, where I work on automating communication between freight actors (container shipping companies, cargo airlines, truckers…) and French customs.
Our systems track all the freight traffic in multiple French harbours and airports and help discover mismanagement issues before illegal payloads can enter or exit the country.

I'm active in the open source ecosystem, mostly as part of the [OpenSavvy](experience/opensavvy.md) organization, which I co-created.

I'm active in the local community groups as the organizer of [BordeauxKt](talks/bordeauxkt.md), the local Kotlin User Group, since 2024.

## Why CLOVIS?

CLOVIS was my first large programming project, back in high-school. I was working on programmable chatbots inspired by [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), so I needed a similar name. I created my GitHub account at the time, and the name stuck, even if the project itself is long gone.

After becoming a professional software engineer, I merged my online and offline identities; I know go interchangeably by Ivan or CLOVIS.
