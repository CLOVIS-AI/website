# 4SH workshops

!!! note ""
    4SH workshops are held in French.

[4SH](../experience/4sh.md) holds regular internal talks, called Workshops, in which employees with any job title can share their knowledge to everyone else.

This page lists the various workshops I have given as an employee at 4SH.

## Arrow Typed Errors

[Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) is an organization creating libraries to complement the Kotlin ecosystem. Their most well-known project, Typed Errors (Arrow Core) adds an idiomatic, performant and typesafe way to manage errors.

This talk compares error management in Java, its direct equivalent in Kotlin, and its Arrow variant.

## Kotlin Multiplatform

[Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) allows compiling Kotlin code to multiple targets. This talk demonstrates the configuration required to create a Kotlin/JVM backend that shares code with a Kotlin/JS frontend, and lists my experience with architecting multiplatform apps: which code to share, which to keep separate.

## Decouple

[Decouple](https://gitlab.com/opensavvy/ui/decouple) is an experimental library I am developing to split UI business logic from UI styling logic, allowing to deploy the same app with multiple completely different branding or look and feel.

When Decouple became my [4SH R&D project](../experience/4sh.md#perpetual-improvement), I showcased it to the rest of the company. I'm not aware of any recordings of this talk.
