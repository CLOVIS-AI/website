# BDX I/O

!!! note ""
    BDX I/O events are held in French.

[BDX I/O](https://bdxio.fr/) is the main tech conference in my hometown of Bordeaux, south-west France.

Since 2022, I’ve attended the conference each year.

## 2025

Just like in 2024, I was invited to represent the Kotlin community at BDX I/O.

Since 2024, I participated in creating the [Grappe Numérique](https://www.lagrappenumerique.fr/), which was represented at BDX I/O.

## 2024

In 2024, I was invited to BDX I/O to hold the Local Communities stand, as the organizer of the [local Kotlin user group](bordeauxkt.md). I spent the day getting in touch with employees from various companies to discuss their adoption of Kotlin, answer their questions and organize the sharing of information between communities.
