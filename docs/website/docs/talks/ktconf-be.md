KtConf is the largest Kotlin conference in Belgium.

## KtMongo: the future of MongoDB in Kotlin

I showcased my work on [KtMongo](https://ktmongo.opensavvy.dev) at the first edition of KTConf, in 2025. I explained the differences between different MongoDB drivers, explained how DSLs make Kotlin more readable, and a few tricks around library authorship.

This session was not recorded.
