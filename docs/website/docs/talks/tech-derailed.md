# Tech Derailed

Tech Derailed is an online live show I co-host along with [David Herman](https://github.com/bitspittle) and [Raphaël Blard](https://github.com/nyublara).

We use the live format to discuss many topics, from recent tech events (conferences…), news about our respective projects, code review, or career advice.

To view our recorded discussions, [visit our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TechDerailed).
