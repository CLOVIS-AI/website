# BordeauxKt

!!! note ""
    BordeauxKt events are most of the time held in French.

Since 2024, I organize [BordeauxKt](https://bordeauxkt.io/), the Kotlin user group in Bordeaux, south-west France.

I typically speak at all events to introduce recent news (latest Kotlin versions, other related events) and the speakers. On this page, I only list events where I did more than introduce the topic.

## KtMongo: the future of MongoDB in Kotlin

I showcased my work on [KtMongo](https://ktmongo.opensavvy.dev) at Betclic, demonstrating how DSLs can make database queries more readable, and how Kotlin allows small teams to create large projects efficiently.

The recording of this session is not available.

## Kotlin, beyond the JVM

During the first meeting of BordeauxKt, I gave a short talk on the history of Kotlin: from its creation, its initial goals of improving on top of Java, and its reach in the Android, Apple, desktop and web ecosystems, including current limitations and future objectives.
