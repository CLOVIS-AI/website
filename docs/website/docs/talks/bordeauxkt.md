# BordeauxKt

!!! note ""
    BordeauxKt events are held in French.

Since 2024, I organize [BordeauxKt](https://bordeauxkt.io/), the Kotlin user group in Bordeaux, south-west France.

## Kotlin, beyond the JVM

During the first meeting of BordeauxKt, I gave a short talk on the history of Kotlin: from its creation, its initial goals of improving on top of Java, and its reach in the Android, Apple, desktop and web ecosystems, including current limitations and future objectives.
